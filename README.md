# Deep Learning Project: Generating Realistic Images from Sketches using CGAN

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a system capable of generating realistic images from sketches utilizing a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). The system will take a sketch as input along with a corresponding label and produce high-quality images that accurately represent the characteristics associated with the provided label.

## Key Components

- **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)**: Implementation of a CGAN architecture that effectively leverages both sketch input and label information for image generation.
- **Label Conditioning**: Ensures generated images align with specified attributes by conditioning on provided labels.
- **Sketch-to-Image Translation**: Mechanisms within the generator network translate input sketches into visually coherent images using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset required for training and evaluation is sourced from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vYv5SmA6nu4PKB_5PIk6FoTCtyEWztKP?usp=sharing), consisting of:
- **Training Dataset**: Includes paired training images and labels, and unpaired training sketches.
- **Testing Dataset**: Contains test images, labels, and unpaired test sketches for evaluation purposes.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: CGAN Implementation and Evaluation

- **Objective**: Implement CGAN architecture and evaluate its performance.
- **Metrics**: Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) used to assess image quality and diversity.

### Experiment 2: Classifier Evaluation on Generated Images

- **Objective**: Compare classification accuracy between original test set images and CGAN-generated images.
- **Results**: Utilized a pre-trained ResNet18 classifier and reported accuracy metrics.

## Implementation Details

- **Python Libraries**: PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn.
- **Model Architecture**: Details of conditional generator and discriminator architectures.
- **Training Process**: Steps for data loading, preprocessing, loss functions, and optimizer configurations.
- **Testing and Evaluation**: Methodologies for testing on unseen data and evaluating performance metrics.

## Results

- **Generated Images**: Visualizations and qualitative assessment.
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Reported FID, IS, and accuracy scores.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using CGANs for generating realistic images from sketches. It highlights advancements in image synthesis through deep learning techniques.
